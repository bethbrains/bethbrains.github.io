You may have seen my friend Christian's post revealing that you can actually use emoji in Salesforce formulas. _Just a big joke, right?_ Nope. I believe we Salesforce professionals can do our jobs _and_ have a sense of humour about it. Let's bring some delight to our users, right? Smiles = adoption.

So in that spirit, here are a few humorous-yet-justifiable uses for emoji in your org.

### Birthdays
If you have a "Next Birthday" formula field, you _could_ render it in a formula text field that appends a :tada: if it's their birthday today.

### Acknowledgments
