I work with nonprofits to help them deliver more effectively on their missions through technology, specifically Salesforce. I enjoy sharing creative ideas about how to use the Salesforce platform and solve complex requirements by pushing its declarative boundaries (read: without code). That said, I'm actively taming the coding beast.

I was named a Salesforce MVP in 2014, primarily for my contributions on the [Power of Us Hub](https://powerofus.force.com/pubhome). I also co-lead the [Vancouver (BC) Nonprofit User Group](https://success.salesforce.com/0F9300000001rND) and  helped author the [Advanced Formulas Trailhead module](https://www.buttonclickadmin.com/trailhead-formulas-admin-love/).

I am a Salesforce Certified Developer, App Builder, Administrator, Advanced Administrator, and Sales Cloud Consultant. I guess I like tests.

I also geek out about baby carriers, Lego, food, choral music, dog sledding, and more sci-fi and superhero fandoms than I can list here.
